This archive contains an implementation of the Random Sample
Consensus (Ransac) framework for robust parameter estimation.

The archive includes the following files:
1. Project files for VC++ 6.0.
2. A Unix Makefile.
3. Source files:
   Point2D.{cpp,h} - Primitive 2D point class used in the example.
   ParameterEstimator.h - A virtual class, the ancestor of all parameter estimators.
   LineParamEstimator.{cpp,h} - Class which implements the virtual functions defined by
                                the ParameterEstimator class, for 2D lines.
   Ransac.h - Template implementation of the Ransac algorithm.
   RansacExample.cpp - An example which shows how to use the Ransac template.

Notes:
1. The math underlying the code which performs a least squares fit for the line
   is described in the summary on Principle Component Analysis (PCA) found on my web
   site (look under lesson handouts). Read the orthogonal least squares section and the
   section about eigenvectors/eigenvalues of symmetric 2X2 matrices.
2. For a detailed description of the Ransac see:

     A Paradigm for Model Fitting with Applications to Image Analysis and Automated Cartography'',
     Communications of the ACM, Vol. 24(6), 1981.

3. This template implementation has been successfully used to estimate the parameters of:
   a. lines
   b. circles
   c. ellipses
   d. homographies

   I only provide the line parameter estimator as it is the only estimator that does not require
   the availability of linear algebra packages or non-linear optimization code.
